        <br />
        In this mini music game, explore the universe in search of alien radio stations playing alien music.
        <br />
        <br />
        The button teleports you to new neighborhoods in the universe, the knob tunes your radio, and the joystick
        moves you through the map. The screen displays the distance from each alien station, which appear
        on the map once you come within 20 units of them. Station colors correspond to their channel frequencies -
        try to tune your spacecraft to match, to get the clearest signal. Once you've found all four stations in this
        neighborhood, feel free to teleport to a new neighborhood.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our friendly neighborhood alien radio stations play four different types of music: ADDITIVE, GLOOPY, GRANULAR,
        and BACKWARDS. Each neighborhood has its own subtle take on these genres - see if you can tell.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight:bolder; font-size:20px">ARTISTIC VISION</span> <br />
        This project idea was heavily influenced by the need to incorporate a potentiometer and a joystick.
        The potentiometer made me think of a radio and tuning into frequencies, while the joystick made
        me think of motion through a map. I also wanted to explore using jit.matrix objects in MaxMSP to create
        interactive visuals, and I had aliens on the mind from discussing astrobiology for graduate school
        programs. Eventually, I got the idea to tune into alien radio channels that would play different types of music.
        <br />
        <br />
        I initially had the alien stations stay hidden throughout, but they were difficult to find without looking
        at the distance measures and difficult to tune properly without looking at the frequency outputs. I therefore
        decided to have the stations pop up on the map after discovery, as if you've marked them on the map.
        <br />
        <br />
        The alien sounds themselves were created based on synthesis techniques I had previously explored
        and wanted to play around with a bit more. This project gave me a good chance to experiment with building
        small-scale patches focused on the very specific techniques of additive synthesis, delay, granular synthesis,
        and reverse playback.
        <br />
        <br />
        The hardware enclosure was designed to evoke both a physical radio and a handheld game controller, since it
        functions as both.

        <span style="font-weight:bolder; font-size:20px">PATCH WALKTHROUGH</span> <br />
        The main patch, alienradio.maxpat, is broken up into 15 sections.<br />
        <br />
        <img src="images/patch-overview.png" style="width: 100%"><br />
        <br />


        <b>Section 1</b> parses values from the serial connection and separates out the button press,
        joystick xval, joystick yval, joystick button, and potentiometer val. The metronome in
        this section polls the serial connection every 10ms.<br />
        <br />
        <figure>
            <img src="images/section1.png" style="width:25%; margin-left: 37.5%; margin-right: 37.5% ">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center">section 1</figcaption>
        </figure><br />
        <br />


        <b>Section 2 </b>processes the joystick readings. The first JavaScript object,
        <a href="max_files/joystick.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joystick.js</a>,
        turns the input values between 0-4095 into 0/1 for up/down motion, and 0/1 for left/right motion.
        The second JavaScript object,
        <a href="max_files/joystick.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coords.js</a>, takes
        these values as input. It keeps track of the spaceship’s current coordinates, and updates them
        according to the up/down/left/right motion. This update gets polled every 80ms by the metronome
        in <b>Section 2</b>, which controls the speed of the spaceship.
        <br />
        <figure>
            <img src="images/section2.png" style="width:25%; margin-left: 37.5%; margin-right: 37.5% ">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center">section 2</figcaption>
        </figure><br />
        <br />



        <b>Section 3</b> processes the button press. It uses a trigger object to send out all the values
        necessary to start all the tasks required to “teleport”: generate a new background of stars,
        generate new alien station locations, generate new alien channel frequencies, and reset the
        spaceship position to the center of the map.
        <br />
        <figure>
            <img src="images/section3.png" style="width:40%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30% ">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center">section 3</figcaption>
        </figure><br />
        <br />



        <b>Section 4</b> displays the spaceship on the map. It takes updated spaceship coordinate values
        from <b>Section 2</b> (as well as the reset center coordinates from <b>Section 3</b>), and displays the spaceship
        by toggling between two jit.matrix objects: imbuf1, which always only contains the background stars,
        and imbuf2, on which the spaceship’s pixel is drawn.
        <br />
        <figure>
            <img src="images/section4.png" style="width:40%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30% ">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center">section 4</figcaption>
        </figure><br />
        <br />




        <b>Section 5 </b>generates the star background and the alien station locations. When the button is pressed,
        Section 3 sends a bang to the JavaScript object
        <a href="max_files/newspace.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newspace.js</a>, which outputs
        random coordinates for the stars and alien station. The stars get drawn onto both jit.matrix objects.
        The alien station coordinates are sent out to other sections.
        <br />
        <figure>
            <img src="images/section5.png" style="width:40%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30% ">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center">section 5</figcaption>
        </figure><br />
        <br />



        <b>Section 6 </b>processes the potentiometer readings. The JavaScript object
        <a href="max_files/pot.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pot.js</a> assigns RGB values
        to the spaceship according to the readings, and also converts the reading into a radio channel
        “frequency” that the spaceship is “listening” to (the frequency is the variable ‘filt’ in pot.js).
        <br />
        <figure>
            <img src="images/section6.png" style="width:40%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30% ">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center">section 6</figcaption>
        </figure><br />
        <br />




        <b>Section 7</b> simply takes the alien station coordinates from <b>Section 5</b> and packs
        them into a list, to send to <b>Section 8</b>.
        <br />
        <figure>
            <img src="images/section7.png" style="width:40%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30% ">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center">section 7</figcaption>
        </figure><br />
        <br />



        <b>Section 8</b> calculates the spaceship’s current distance from each alien station.
        The JavaScript object
        <a href="max_files/distance.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distance.js</a>
        takes in the spaceship’s current coordinates as well as each of the alien station coordinates,
        and it computes the Euclidean distance to each station.
        <br />
        <figure>
            <img src="images/section8.png" style="width:40%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30% ">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center">section 8</figcaption>
        </figure><br />
        <br />




        <b>Section 9 </b>marks the alien locations on the map once the spaceship reaches a proximity
        of 20 distance units. It uses each alien stations’ channel “frequency” (calculated in <b>Section 10</b>)
        to calculate the station’s RGB values, and draws the station’s pixel onto both jit.matrix objects
        once the distance is less than 20.
        <br />
        <figure>
            <img src="images/section9.png" style="width:100%">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center">section 9</figcaption>
        </figure><br />
        <br />



        <b>Section 10 </b>generates each station’s channel frequency, and also calculates the volume of
        each channel. When the button is pressed, Section 3 sends a bang to the JavaScript object
        <a href="max_files/channel.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">channel.js</a>, which then
        generates random channel frequencies. channel.js also takes in the current spaceship frequency
        and the current distances to each alien station, and outputs volume such that the station is
        louder when within 20 distance units, and loudest when it is within range and tuned into the
        proper frequency. It also calculates the volume for the radio “static”.
        <br />
        <figure>
            <img src="images/section10.png" style="width:50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25% ">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center">section 10</figcaption>
        </figure><br />
        <br />





        <b>Section 11</b> controls the radio “static” sound. It consists of white noise through a
        simple bandpass filter, whose filter frequency is controlled by the potentiometer.
        <br />
        <figure>
            <img src="images/section11.png" style="width:10%; margin-left: 45%; margin-right: 45% ">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center">section 11</figcaption>
        </figure><br />
        <br />



        <b>Sections 12-15</b> are the source of the alien radios’ sounds.
        They each (except backwards-alien) take initial values generated by
        <a href="max_files/seqgen.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seqgen.js</a>
        at each “teleport”.
        <br />
        <figure>

        <span style="font-weight:bolder; font-size:20px">SOUND PATCHES</span> <br />
        <br />
        <b>1. ADDITIVE-ALIEN</b><br />
        <br />
        <img src="images/additive-alien.png" style="width: 100%"><br />
        <br />
        <b>Sound generation:</b> This first sound uses simple additive synthesis of ten sine waves,
        each with its own amplitude envelope and frequency multiplier. It was developed with inspiration
        from
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMIVJ8DqMhs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Youtube video</a>.
        I also added a very simple delay line.<br />
        <b>Sequencing:</b> The sequencer takes ten initial frequency values, provided by
        <a href="max_files/seqgen.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seqgen.js</a>.
        It randomizes the duration of each note, and also shuffles the order of the initial frequencies
        at random intervals.<br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <b>2. GLOOP-ALIEN</b><br />
        <br />
        <img src="images/gloopy-alien.png" style="width: 100%"><br />
        <br />
        <b>Sound generation:</b> this sound uses a sine wave through a randomized delay
        line developed from
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ovgYEdfIV8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            this Youtube video
        </a>, and pans the dry signal with an LFO.<br />
        <b>Sequencing:</b> The sequencer takes eight initial frequency values provided by
        <a href="max_files/seqgen.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seqgen.js</a>,
        and sets the sine wave frequency at random times. The simple amplitude envelope is triggered every second.<br />
        <br />
        <br />


        <b>3. GRANULAR-ALIEN</b><br />
        <br />
        <img src="images/granular-alien.png" style="width: 100%"><br />
        <br />
        <b>Sound generation:</b> this sound samples two audio files,
        <a href="max_files/grain-1.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grain-1.mp3</a> and
        <a href="max_files/grain-2.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grain-2.mp3</a>,
        and performs granular synthesis developed from
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3nAeDWgf9Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            this Youtube video
        </a>. I also added mirrored panning to both.<br />
        <b>Sequencing:</b> The sequencer takes eight initial duration values provided by
        <a href="max_files/seqgen.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seqgen.js</a>,
        and iterates through them at random intervals. These duration values are also used
        to generate the pan values.<br />
        <br />
        <br />


        <b>4. BACKWARDS-ALIEN</b><br />
        <br />
        <img src="images/backwards-alien.png" style="width: 60%;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%"><br />
        <br />
        This very simple patch plays <a href="max_files/grain-1.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grain-1.mp3</a> and
        <a href="max_files/grain-2.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grain-2.mp3</a> backwards, and pans them in opposite
        directions with an LFO.<br />
        <br />
        Thanks for reading!
